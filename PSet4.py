        * If the user inputs 'e', immediately exit the game.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'n', 'r', or 'e', keep asking them again.

    2) Asks the user to input a 'u' or a 'c'.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'c' or 'u', keep asking them again.

    3) Switch functionality based on the above choices:
        * If the user inputted 'n', play a new (random) hand.
        * Else, if the user inputted 'r', play the last hand again.
          But if no hand was played, output "You have not played a hand yet.

          game with the selected hand, using compPlayHand.
